## Project Overview  
Bellabeat, a high-tech company focusing on women’s health, wants to gain insights from **smart device usage trends** to **enhance its marketing strategy** and **increase product adoption**.  

## Business Objectives  
- Identify **key trends in smart device usage**.  
- Understand **how these trends apply to Bellabeat customers**.  
- Develop **data-driven recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy**.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns.  
- **Data Segmentation:** Categorized users into Low, Moderate, and High activity levels.  
- **Data Visualization:** Employed `ggplot2` for creating insightful plots.  

## Key Insights  
- **User Activity Levels:** Many users take fewer than 10,000 steps daily, suggesting an opportunity to encourage more movement.  
- **Sedentary Behavior:** Even among active users, sedentary minutes remain high. Users may benefit from movement reminders.  
- **Sleep Patterns:** A strong correlation exists between sleep duration and time in bed, but some users may have poor sleep efficiency.  
- **Day-of-Week Trends:** Activity levels fluctuate throughout the week, which can inform engagement strategies.  

## Recommendations  
- **Encourage Low & Moderate Activity Users** → Position Bellabeat as an entry-level fitness tracker to help users gradually increase their steps.  
- **Support High Activity Users** → Market advanced analytics and progress tracking for users already taking 10,000+ steps.  
- **Leverage Sedentary Trends** → Introduce features like **"Active Hour Alerts"** to encourage users to move more frequently.  
- **Promote Sleep & Recovery Features** → Highlight Bellabeat as a wellness tool with improved sleep-tracking capabilities.  
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Activity Campaigns** → Adjust marketing messages based on activity fluctuations throughout the week.  

## Next Steps  
- Further segment users to identify patterns based on demographics or fitness goals.  
- Explore seasonal trends to understand how activity changes over time.  
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns using insights from activity and sleep data.
